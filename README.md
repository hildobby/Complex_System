# Complex System Simulation: Expanding and exploring the Bak-Snappen model

2 Dimensions Bak-Snappen model, evaluation of the resulting model behaviour and effect of various parameters.

## Setup required packages

Gathering the required packages
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Running the model
```
python3 main.py
```

Generating the presentation from the `results_presentation.ipynb` Jupyter notebook
```
jupyter nbconvert results_presentation.ipynb --to slides --post serve
```

An overview of the results can also be found in [the Jupyter notebook file](https://github.com/hildobby/Complex_System/blob/master/results_overview.ipynb) named `results_overview.ipynb`.

## Project Plan

1. Bring the 1 dimension Bak-Snappen model to 2 dimensions and 3 dimensions
2. Evaluate different results from the model:
    * Avalanche time and compare it between several models
    * Mutation distance (Check if power law still applies here)
    * Cluster sizes
    * Evolutionary time
3. Test the data with the [powerlaw](https://pypi.org/project/powerlaw/) package
